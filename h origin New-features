    Race Day
    Codecademyâ€™s annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.
    
    As a timeline, registration would look like this:registration-timeline
    
    Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.
    
    Race number:
    
    Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
    All others receive a number below 1000.
    Start time:
    
    Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
    Early adults run at 9:30 am.
    Late adults run at 11:00 am.
    Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
    But we didnâ€™t plan for runners that are exactly 18! Weâ€™ll handle that by the end of the project.
